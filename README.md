# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application  This full-stack site takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.





### Instructions

1. This Turtletastic survey should has 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

### Demonstration

### deployment 
2.  Heroku link 
https://nameless-escarpment-98264.herokuapp.com/


lessons learned: JSON files are more specific than I had previously imagind, I had an extra line break that was preventing my deployment, and a previous server test was also.  I appreciate feedback (feedback is a gift always) and thank you for visiting this page.

Plans for future iterations: create a composer based friend finder, allowing access to camera for student/user to upload their picture.  Storing the user input on a database.  The purpose of this would be to help build community in a music composition class for younger students.  They'd create a mini yearbook of sorts- alongside composers and how they relate to each other.
